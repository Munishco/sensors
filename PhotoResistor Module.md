# SENSORS
## 1. PHOTORESISTOR MODULE

**Introduction**

In this experiment, we will learn how to use the photo-resistor module.
Photo-resistor is very common in our daily life. it is mainly used in intelligent switch so as to 
bring convenience to our life. At the same time, in our daily life, we also use it in electronic 
design. So in order to use it in a better, we provide the corresponding modules to help us to 
use it more conveniently and efficiently.

**Components**

- 1 * Arduino Uno board
- 1 * USB cable
- 1 * photo-resistor module
- DuPont wires(Female to Male)

**Principle**

Photo-resistor module is a photosensitive semiconductor device. In addition to high 
sensitivity, fast response, spectral characteristics and same r value, it can maintain a high 
level of stability and reliability in the high temperature, wet and bad environment. It can be 
widely apply in the camera, solar garden lamp, lawn lamp, counterfeit detector, quartz 
clock, music cup, gift boxes, mini night light, street lamp automatic switch and all kinds of 
electric toys, electric lighting, lamps and lanterns, and other areas of the light 
automatically on-off controller area.
